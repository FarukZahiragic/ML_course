        "# PyTorch Basics\n",
        "[PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) is a deep learning framework. PyTorch works with tensors which are multidimensional arrays similar to the ones used in NumPy. Since you have already used NumPy in previous exercises we will introduce PyTorch in terms of the main differences from NumPy:\n",
        "* PyTorch can run operations on both CPU and hardware accelerators like GPUs. GPUs are particularly well suited for doing matrix multiplications which make up most of the computation in neural networks. Using GPUs can speed training up drastically, often on the order of ~100x for decently sized neural networks involving large matrix-matrix multiplications.\n",
        "* PyTorch has automatic differentiation that allows it to compute the derivatives of most functions. You don't need to derive or implement the formulas for the gradients. This is especially useful for training neural networks through gradient descent.\n",
        "* PyTorch provides implementations of various neural network components, dataloading utilities, and optimization tools, making it much easier to specify and train neural networks.\n",
        "\n",
        "Make sure you have PyTorch installed ([see instructions](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/)) or run this notebook on Google colab (recommended if you don't have a GPU). You can import PyTorch as:"

        "## PyTorch Tensors\n",
        "Tensors (`torch.Tensor`) are similar to the multidimensional arrays used in NumPy (`numpy.ndarray`). The functions to create them often have similar names and arguments. We will use the function `torch.ones()` to highlight some of the differences between NumPy and PyTorch. The signatures for the two functions are:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "torch.ones(*size, *, out=None, dtype=None, layout=torch.strided, device=None, requires_grad=False)\n",
        "numpy.ones(shape, dtype=None, order='C', *, like=None)\n",
        "```\n",
        "* There are often subtle differences in the syntax. For example, the size argument of `torch.ones` can either accept a tuple or a variable number of integers but  NumPy only supports a tuple/list. Another common one is that PyTorch referes to `axis` as `dim` in operations such as `sum` and `mean`.\n",
        "* Each tensor has a device associated with it and resides in the memory of that device. This is specified via the device argument used in all tensor creation ops. By default, this is the CPU (`device='cpu'`), but can also be the GPU (`device='cuda'`) or e.g. `device='cuda:0'` if you have many GPUs. All tensors involved in a given operation e.g. addition or matrix multiplication must recide on the same device. An existing tensor `T` can be moved to other devices in through commands such as `T.cpu()`, `T.cuda()`, `T.to(device='cuda')`. Each of these will return a new copy of the tensor on the target device.\n",
        "* The default floating point precision in PyTorch is `torch.float32` but in NumPy this varies more and is often `numpy.float64`. If you are unfamiliar with floating point numbers, you can think of them as being equivalent to the scientific notation e.g. $\\pm 1.23456 \\cdot 10^{E}$, but in binary. Each format supports a specific range for the exponent $E$ and has a given number of significant digits. Float32 operations typically run significantly faster than float64 operations and require less memory, but are not as precise. For neural networks you should not use float64 unless you have a really good reason for it. In fact many operations in neural networks can be performed in even lower precision such as `torch.bfloat16` or `torch.float16`. These formats require less memory and run faster on hardware that supports it, but may require special tricks for training.\n",
        "* Each tensor T in PyTorch can either have `T.requires_grad==True` or `T.requires_grad==False`. When requires_grad is True, PyTorch will keep track of operations involving this tensor in a structure referred to as a computation graph. PyTorch can backpropagate through a computation graph to compute gradients for the tensors involved."

        "### Exercise 1.2 - Model Definition\n",
        "In this part we will create a simple model function for a ReLU fully connected network. We break the implementation down into several functions.\n",
        "\n",
        "We assume the model has $L$ layers, an input dimension of 2, and output dimension of 1.\n",
        "The inputs to the model are $X_0$ an $N \\times 2$ matrix.\n",
        "We use $K_{i}$ to denote the number of units in the $i$-th layer (i.e. their width or dimension, $i=1$ is the first layer). We assume the width of all the hidden layers (every layer except the last one) is constant, $K_i=K$. We set $K_0=2$ and $K_{L}=1$ corresponding to the number of input features and the dimension of the output.\n",
        "\n",
        "Layer $i$ computes the following:\n",
        "$$X_{i} = \\phi(X_{i-1} W_{i} + b_{i})$$\n",
        "Where $\\phi=ReLU$ for all layers except the last one where it is identity, $W_{i}$ is a $K_{i-1} \\times K_{i}$ matrix and $b_{i}$ is a bias vector with $K_{i}$ elements.\n",
        "\n",
        "The first function `get_model_weights(L, K)` will create the weight and bias tensors. It takes in $L$ and $K$ and returns a list of $L$ matrices and a separate list of $L$ biases corresponding the layers in order.\n",
        "* The biases should be set to zero, have dtype=torch.float32 and have requires_grad=True.\n",
        "* The matrices should be initialized with an element-wise normal distribution with mean zero and standard deviation $\\sqrt{2/K_{i-1}}$ where $K_{i-1}$ is the width of the input to the layer. This initialization strategy is called either Kaiming He initialization and aims to preserve the variance of activations on the forward pass accounting for a ReLU non-linearity. The weight matrices should also have dtype=torch.float32 and requires_grad=True.\n",
        "* Note that you might need to create the weights in a couple of steps. Make sure that the weights returned have requires_grad=True and are not intermediate tensors in a computation graph, i.e. they are not derived from other tensors with requires_grad=True. PyTorch has [various functions](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torch.html#random-sampling) to sample random tensors.\n",
        "\n",
        "The second function `predict(X, weights, biases)` takes in the inputs $X$ (i.e. $X_0$) as well as the list of weights and biases created by `get_model_weights`. It computes the output of the neural network according to the formula above. Here [torch.clamp](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.clamp.html), [torch.mm](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.mm.html) and/or the `@` operator could be useful."

We will be using a fully connected network so we flatten each element into a $d=784$ element vector. We will have one output for each class.
